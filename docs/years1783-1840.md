## Land Ordinance of 1785 

### Overview
Law that said the land of the old NW should be used to help pay off the national debt. Saod that the land would be divided into townships (and the 16th section of each town was to be made a school). 

### Related: Northwest Ordinance of 1787
Set rules for how a state could join the Union.
- Solved the problem that kings were trying to solve for a while

Said that a state could join if:

1. It started off as a territory 
2. The territory gained 60,000 inhabitants

Important: The law also forbade slavery in the Old Northwest

### Effect
Saved America from another revolution, (The West against the East)
- If America had attempted to chain new territories in permanent subordination, there would have been an early CW

## Virginia Plan 
### Overview
Reprentation in Congress should be based on represetntation. This conflicted directly with the **New Jersey Plan**, which called for equal represntation in Congress. 

### Effect
The Great Compromise resulted in a bi-cameral legislature, in which there would be a Senate in which all states have equal representation and a House of Representatives where states would send delegates based on population.

This compromise plan was known as the Connecticut plan.

## Federalists 

### Overview
Believed in a strong federal government, supported the constitution. Eventually died out after the election of Thomas Jefferson. Their chief rival, the Anti-Federalists, evolved into the Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican party.

### Important Federalists
- Alexander Hamilton -  Leader of the Party
- George Washington - Though not officially a federalist, he backed most Federalist ideas as president
- John Marshall - 4th Chief Justice of the US, kept Federalist ideas alive and well through the Supreme Court even when the Federalist Party was dead
- James Madison - Wrote the Constituion, but became a Democratic-Republican later
- John Adams -  2nd President of the USA, had a very unpopular presidency but his Federalist actions may have saved the country (Looking at you, early war with France)
- John Jay - 1st Chief Justice

## The Federalist Papers 

### Overview
Collection of essays that discuss the need for the Constituion. They also explain how the Constituion will work, and are used to this day to interpret the Constitution
### Authors
- Alexander Hamilton
- John Jay
- James Madison

## Whiskey Rebellon 1794

### Overview
Rebellion by poor famers against the federal government
### Cause
As part of his financial plan, implemented an excise tax on whiskey, which hurt many in south-western Pennsylvania. The people there felt the tax was being imposed on a economic necesity (as whiskey was used as a form of payment). The protesters tarred and feathered revenue officers just as the original Revolutionaries had done.
### Effect
Washington, not tolerating these "self-created societies", with Hamilton's encouragement, called up the militias of many states and crushed the rebellion. By using such a force, Washington gained a new respect for his government - but also some criticism at such massive use of force.

## Hamilton and the Bank of the US 

### Overview
Hamilton proposed a bank for the us that would be a powerful private institution of which the government would be the major stock holder and in which the Federal Treasury would deposit excess money. Thus, the central government would have a strongbox and also stimulate buisness by being in circulation. In addition, the bank would be able to print needed paper money.

Jefferson opposed completely, and said that only the states could charter banks (literal interpretation of the Constitution). Hamilton however, argued that Congress can pass out any laws to carry out the powers vested in various government agencies (Article I, Section VIII, Paragraph 18). Essentially, Hamilton argued that government had the power to collect taxes and regulate trade, and thus they could create this Bank. 

## Jay's Treaty 

### Overview
This was a treaty that John Jay signed in order to keep peace with Great Britain.

### Cause

### Effect


## Washington's Farewell

### Overview
Washington's resignation speech which set several impotant precendents regarding power and international affairs.

### Effect
**Two Terms**: Washington only served for two terms, and thus every president except FDR (Fighting WWII needed a consistent voice) also did so.

**No Intertangling Alliances**: Washington argued that we should not make any permanent alliances without nations (looking at you, alliance with France). Washington did however approve *temporary* alliances. This set US Foreign policy until WWII (That war changed a lot)


## Alien and Sediton Acts 1798

### Overview
Laws passed under the John Adams administration that made it a crime to impede government policies or falsey defame its officials (Sedition) and gave the president the power to import or imprison immigrants during times of hostitility (Alien).
### Cause
The Alien Act was passed to give more power with a war against France becoming more and more iminent. In addition, a significant portion of Jeffersonian Democrats were immigrants, and were opposing Adams.

During his administration, Adams was often ridiculed, often by members of his own party (\*ahem\* **Alexander Hamilton**). In addition, at that time, the verbal violence was unrestrained, and many writers (some of them exiled aliens) sought out to destroy Adams. 
### Effect
They increased Jeffersonian resentment to the laws and the Federalist system, especially because the Supreme Court refused to ruled against the laws (as the Court was very federalist).

This eventually resulted in the <a href="#virginia-and-kentucky-resolutions-1798-1799">Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions</a>.
## Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions 1798-1799

###Overview
Jefferson and Madison, angered by the Alien and Sedition Acts, wrote these resolutions that said that states were the final authority of whether the federal government overstepped its powers granted by the constitution. He said that therefore, if a state believed that the federal government had overpassed its power, it would have the power to **nullify** the law they find offensive. 

###Effect
States Rights arguers will go back to this. Also, the concept of nullification will come back in the South Carolinian nullification crisis

##  XYZ Affair 

###Overview
Incident in France in which Adams sent his diplomats (including John Marshall) to negotiate with French foreign minister Talleyrand about hostilities the US was facing after they had accepted Jay's Treaty. (The French were attacking US Ships and refused to accept the US Ambassador).

However, once Adams' diplomats reached France, French agents X, Y, and Z (identities kept secret) demanded 32 million florins + $250,000 as a bribe to just talk to Talleyrand.

###Effect
Negotiations broke down, and the diplomats were treated like heroes for not caving in. The slogan "Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute" became popular.

Also, Jeffersonian Democrats, who had backed the French, took to the shadows as their Pro-French views suddenly became popular. 

###War Preperations
After the affair, the government decided to start preparing for war. The Navy Department was created, Marine Corps were reestablished and the nation was about to fall into war, if it wasn't for Adams' wise choice to negotiate more with Talleyrand. At France, the **Convention of 1800** was signed, and the nations remained at peace. If Adams had not signed the treaty and instead went to war, he would have most likely won a second term. However, his willingness to peace likely helped Jefferson when he went to buy Louisiana just three years later.


##  Washingtons First Cabnet 

- **John Adams**: Vice President (Not actually part of the cabinet, but he's here)
- **Alexander Hamilton**: Secretary of the Treasury
- **Thomas Jefferson**: Secretary of State

No one else matters :P, but here they are anyways:

- **Henry Knox**: Secretary of War (We call this 'Defense' today)
- **Edmund Randolph**: Attorney General

##  Bill of Rights 

### Overview
In order to pass the Constitution, the Federalists promised that a Bill of Rights would be added later. 

James Madison, original author of the Constitution, decided to write the 10 amendments that would become the first 10 amendments of the Constitution and would be called "The Bill of Rights"

##  Judiciary Act of 1789 

###Overview
Organized the Supreme Court (John Jay became Chief Justice), and also established the federal district and circuit courts and the office of attorney general.

##  Pinckney's Treaty of 1795 

###Overview
Treaty with Spain that gave the United States free navigation of the Mississippi, warehouse rights at New Orleans, and Western Florida.
###Cause
Jay's Treaty.


##Marbury vs Madson 

###Overview
A court case that decided that the Supreme Court of the United States had the final say on whether an act was constitutional.
###Cause
In his last days of the presidency, John Adams passed the Judidicary Act of 1801, which essentially filled the entire Justice branch of the government with Federalists. Jefferson, angry at this, threw the law out. However, William Marbury sued for his commission, and his case went to the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall, dismissed his case, but explained his ruling saying that the part of the Judiciary Act Marbury was basing his case on was unconstituional. This gave the Supreme Court the power of **judicial review**.
###Effect
Power went to federal government, not the states.

##The Jeffersonian "Revoluton of 1800" 

###Overview
The election of Thomas Jefferson in 1800. 

###Significance
The first peaceful transition of power in history

##Lousiana Purchase 

###Overview
After Spain ceded Louisiana to France, Americans in the area lost the warehouse rights they gained from Pinckney's treaty, which hurt the frontier farmers who relied on this to make a living. Sensing potential problems (what if Napoleon tried to create an American Empire after Europe?), Jefferson sent Monroe to join Livingston in France to try to buy New Orleans. However, due to the **Hatian Revolution**, Napoleon had lost interest in a North American empire, and due to British pressure on him, Napoleon decided to keep America away from Britain's arms and sell Jefferson not just Louisiana, but the **entire territory of Louisiana**. Monroe and Livingston accepted, needless to say.

###Problems
While Jefferson liked the purchase, he could not help but feel that he had overstepped his authority as President, as he had only been given authority from Congress to buy the city of New Orleans (though Congress was happy to pay for all of Louisiana).

###Effect
Jefferson envisioned this new area as the "Valley of Democracy", that would allow for a great agrarian republic. The purchase also showed Washington's idea of avoiding entangling alliances, as Jefferson made the purchase without swearing loyalty to any countries in the process.

##Embargo Act 1807 

###Overview
Due to war between Britain and France, both countries began stopping all trade going into the other country. America, which was trying to stay neutral, was losing many merchant ships to both countries, especially Great Britain, which was practicing **impressment** on American sailors and seizing American ships (France did too, not as much). Jefferson, believing that both countries relied heavily on American trade, decided that an embargo would convince both countries into working out a deal to trade with America.

###Effect
1. The Embargo failed, and instead nearly destroyed the Northern economy (which completely relied on trade)
	- This in turn led to the Hartford Convention
	- Also led to massive ts after the war
		- That led to the Nullification Crisis (South Carolina)
2. Macon's Bill #2 

##Macon's Bill #2 

###Overview
Reopened trade with all countries, but if either France or Britain reopened commercial restrictions, the embargo would renact against that nation. (basically admitted that the US could not survive without either France or Britain)

###Effect
Napoleon vaguely told America that French restrictions may be removed if Britain removed theirs, which Madison gambled and accepted the note as French repeal and asked for Britain to remove their laws. However, Britain didn't , and the US had no choice but to put an embargo against Britain, thus ending American neutrality. (War)

##War Hawks
###Overview
Young men who sought war with Britain. They were frustrated that Britain was hurting/impressing American sailors.

They also wanted to wipe out the Indians as they were a threat to the pioneer settlers who were migrating west.

##Chesapeake Affair 1807

###Overview
Incident where a British captain demanded the surrender of four *alleged* deserters after stopping a US frigate, *The Chesapeake*. The American captain refused, and the the British warship fired attacks at the ship, killing three Americans and wounding 18 others, and the British took the four deserters away.
###Effect
The people of the US' anger against Britain spiked, and a roar of national wrath occured, and people started calling for war.

##Judiciary Act 1801 

###Overview
Created 16 new judgeships and other federal offices. Seen as a last-ditch grab of power of Adams. Jefferson threw the law out, which lead to William Marbury lawsuit. Which led to <a href="marbury-vs-madison">Marbury vs Madison</a>

##Lewis and Clark 

###Overview
Two explorers employed by Thomas Jefferson to explore the newly purchased Louisiana Territory.

###Effect
They went further than the Louisiana territory, and found the west coast. They also documented their travels extensively, discovered many new plant and animal species, and created a map of the new area.

##Non-Intercourse Act 

###Overview
Formally reopened trade with all foreign nations **except** France and Britain (the two most important).
###Effect
As a result of this and the 1807 Embargo Act, the New England Yankees were left with no option but to reopen newfactories and open new ones, thus creating the foundations of modern America's industrial might.

##Northwest Ordinance of 1787 

###Overview
Created the Northwest territory.
###Cause
It established the precedent by which the Federal government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states.

## John Marshall
###Biography
John Marshall was a strong federalist and the fourth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He kept the ideals behind Federalism alive and well even when the Federalist Party died out. With **Marbury vs Madison**, he set the precendent of Judicial Review. In the below court cases, you will learn about the other precendents he set.
###McCulloch v Maryland 
In this suit, the state of Maryland tried to destroy a branch of the Bank of the US by imposing a tax on its notes. Marshall declared the bank constituional and that Maryland did not have the right to tax the bank. He argued **that the power to tax involves the power to destroy** and **that a power to create implies a power to preserve**. 

This set the doctrine of **loose construction**, the idea that powers not explicitly stated in the Constitution belong to the Federal government.

Marshall also said that the Bank cannot pay taxes because **States do not supercede the Federal Government**, thus saying that **the federal government had more power than state governments**

###Dartmouth v Woodward 
The state of New Hampshire had decided to revoke Darthmouth College's charter (given by King George III in 1769). Marshall said that the original charter must stand, and that the Constituion protected contracts from state encroachments. This protected buisness enterprise from state domination, but it also enabled charter corporations to escape public control.
###Cohens v Virgnia
Two brothers were arrested for illegally selling lottery tickets, and while Virginia still won, Marshall used the case to asert that **The Supreme Court had the right to review decisions of State Supreme Courts**. 
### Gibbons v Ogden 
The State of New York had tried to grant a monopoly of waterborne commerce beween NY and NJ, but Marshall reminded NY that control of interstate commerce remained with Congress alone.
##The Monroe Doctrine
### Overview
Written by **John Quincy Adams** and **James Monroe**, it said argued two features: Noncolonization and Nonintervention

####Noncolonization
- Said that the era of colonization in America was over
- No more countries could come to the Americas to colonize
	- Partly directed to the Russians in the Northwest coming down from Alaska

####Nonintervention 
- Told the monarchs of Europe to keep their monarchy out of their hemisphere/ the Americas
	- Said that the US would not intervene in the Greek war of independence

## Daniel Webster
### Overview
261
A strong federalist and friend of John Marshall. He was famous for challenging states rights and nullification. He was also a strong supporter of the Bank of the US.
## The "North America Review"
### Overview
A highly intellectual magazie that began publication in 1815, showed how American produced materials were increasing after the War of 1812.

##American System 
### Overview
Henry Clay's idea of politics.
Called for:

1. A strong protective tarifff
	- This would allow for eastern manufacturing to florish 
		- Funds from this would pay for another component
2. A Network of Roads and Canals
	- Paid by the tarifff
	- Would allow the transportation of food and raw materials from the South and the West and the North and the East
	- Focused in the Ohio Valley, this would knitt the country econmically and politically
3. A Strong Banking System
	- This would provide easy and abundant credit 

### Effect
This entire system was eventually implemented, though all seperately and not all as one bill.

##Era of Good Feelngs 

###Why So Happy?
Rising nationalism after the War of 1812 (the Americans believed they had defeated the British yet again) led to a 'happy era of good feelings'. Also, with only one party left, this left Monroe and the Republicans to one-party rule.
###Exceptions
The issue of tariffs, the bank of the US, internal immprovements, and the sale of public lands was hotly debated over of. Also, sectionalism was increasing and the debate of slavery was reentering the public forum.

##Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa

###Overview
They were two Shawnee brothers, also known as Tecumseh and the Prophet, who believed that the time had come to fight the Americans. They created a confederacy of all tribes east of the Mississippi and attacked. In the **Battle of Tippecanoe**, the Prophet foolishly attacked Harrison's army, and lost their settlement, resultin in the Prophet being discredited. Tecumseh allied with the British and fought in the War of 1812, but died at the Battle of the Thames in 1813. 

###Effect
The fall of Tecumseh meant the end of an Indian Confederacy.

##Treaty of Ghent 1814

###Overview
Essentially an armistice between Britain and the US. 
###Cause
Britain was preoccupied with the Congress of Vienna, and didn't want to deal with the US. 
###Effect
The Americans believed that they had 'won' the war, which led to massive nationalism, see the <a href="#era-of-good-feelings">Era of Good Feelings</a> for more information


##Hartford Conventon 1814 - 1815

###Overview
Frustrated by embargoes by the US government, the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island sent full representation to a convention at Hartford. New Hampshire and Vermont sent partial representation. The men met in complete secrecy and wrote a list of all their grievances and a few delegants called for seccession. The grievances demanded financial assistance to compensate for lost trade and a Constitutional amendment requiring a 2/3 vote to pass an embargo. Delegates also wished to remove the 3/5 clause of the Constitution, limit Presidents to a single term, and prohibit the election of two successive presidents from the same states (All but one president (Adams) had been from Virginia). However before the grievances were delivered, the Treaty of Ghent was signed, and so the grievances were never considered.

###Significance

Reflected a Federalist fear that New England was alling to the agrarian South and West. Also marks first attempt at seccession.

##Henry Clay

###What he did


##James Madson

###What he did

##Willam Henry Harrison

###Overview
Became a war hero after fighting Indian forces at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. He used his popularity to become president in 1841, but he died after a month, leaving his disliked vice president, John Tyler, to become president.

##Battle of New Orleans

###Overview
The biggest victory for the US in the War of 1812. The battle featured Andrew Jackson as a war hero, who was praised for dealing the most devastating defeat of the entire war. 

###Effect
All though the battle didn't matter (occured after the Treaty of Ghent was signed), the battle made Andrew Jackson a national hero and unleashed a wave of nationalism and confidence.

##Oliver Hazard Perry

###Overview
American naval officer who built a small fleet of ships on Lake Erie and captured a British fleet, thus keeping American control of the lake. His slogan, "We have met the enemy and they are ours" breath a new life into the American cause in the war.
##War of 1812
###Impact
Showed that the US would go to war to resist grievous wrongs. Other nations gained a new respect for America'a fighting prowess, and naval officers like Perry and Macdonough were respected more. American emmisaries abroad were treated with more respect. However the war's embargo seriously hurt the New England economy and increased sectionalism between the New England Federalists, and the entire party was destroyed.


##Missouri Compromse 1820
### Overview
Negotiated by Henry Clay, this compromise kept the balance of power between the North and the South and remained in use until 1854.
### Terms
1. Admitted Missouri as a slave state
2. Created the state of Maine from Massachusets to keep the balance in the Senate
3. Prohibited all slavery in the future above the 36° 30' line (the southern boundary of Misouri)

### Effect
Preserved the shaky compact of the states, but only ducked the question of the South's **pelicular institution** (term for slavery).

##The "Corrupt Bargain"

###Overview
Controversial election in which Andrew Jackson won more votes (popular and electoral) but didn't have a majority to win. Henry Clay, the speaker of the house, disliking Jackson, got the House to support John Quincy Adams. Because he was named the new secretary of state shortly after, many believed that a corrupt bargain was taken.
###Effect
Led to Adams losing trust and failing in his second run for president.

##John Quincy Adams

###Overview
A brilliant Secretary of State under Monroe, ineffective President, and influential Congressman.

###Impact

- Wrote Monroe Doctrine
- Shaped US Foreign Policy
- Negotiated Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819 (Florida Purchase Treaty)
- Outspoken in his opposition to slavery

##Election of 1828/Jacksonian Revolution 

###Overview
The overwhelming election of Andrew Jackson in 1828.

###Importance
Called the "Jacksonian Revolution" because of the high voter turnout from people who recently gained the right to vote (poorer people) which was reflected in the 95 electoral vote landslide Jackson won by.

###The Spoils System
Upon taking office, Jackson replaced most officals with new ones from his new party. This led to some inefficiency, as some qualified officials were booted for incapable, yet loyal, counterparts.

##Nicolas Biddle

###Overview
The president of the Bank of the United States. He held an immense (many people believed unconstitutional) amount of power over the financial affairs of the US.

He was immensely hated, as his bank's very existence to some seemed to sin against the idea of American democracy. His bank also had much opposition in the West due to foreclosures on many western farms. The bank prioritized profit over public service.	

## Second Bank of the US 

###Overview
Part of Henry Clay's American System. It was submitted for renewal under the Jackson Administration by Henry Clay (in order to make it an election issue) but it was rejected by Jackson, who declared the bill "unconstitutional". By doing so, he vastly amplified the power of the presidency by regarding the executive branch as the most powerful branch of the government.

###Andrew Jackson Removes the Bank
In 1833, Jackson decides not just to wait for the Bank to die in 1836, but to instead destroy it. He believed that he had been given a mandate from his voters for its complete exterminiation. 

He started by removing federal deposits from the bank, it order to bleed the bank dry. His cabinet, advising him not too, was reshuffled around until Jackson found a Secretary of the Treasury who was willing to do what Jackson asked. 
However once the Bank completely died, it left a financial vaccum in the US Ecnonmy and launched a lurching cycle of booms and busts. SUrplus funds were placed in several state banks called **pet banks**. These pet banks and smaller 'wildcat' banks - which were very informal, often just chairs and money in a room - flooded the economy with new paper money. Jackson tried to reign in the economy with the **Specie Circular**, which required that all public lands be purchased with "hard" money (metallic). This destroyed the speculative boom, leading to the Panic of 1837.

##Tariffs

###tariff of 1816

#### Overview
The first tariff in American history instituted more protection first, then revenue.
#### Cause
After the War of 1812, British competitors dumped goods on the US, cutting their prices in half in an effort to destroy American factories as they were being born. The tariffs, passed as part of Clay's American System, were passed to protect the new industry.

###Tariff of 1828 / Tariff of Abominatons 

####Overview
Passed in 1828, this tariff was passed again to help Northern industry. However this one was promoted by Ardent Jacksonites, expecting the bill to be defeated, which would hurt Adams during his presidency. However, it passed, leaving Jackson to deal with it.

####Effect
Southerners were particularly outraged by this tariff, and labeled it, the "Tariff of Abominations". However, the South was frustrated that the rest of America was doing well economically and they were falling on hard times, leaving the tariff as a scapegoat. Additionally, the South was worried that Congress would soon pass a bill prohibiting slavery, and the South wanted to test the theory of **nullification**, that is, the idea that States have the right to nullify a federal law. This took effect in the **Nullification Crisis**

###Nullification Crisis

###Overview
The South Carolina legislature published a pamplet, called *The South Carolina Exposition*. Secrety written by **John C. Calhoun**, the Vice President of the United States, the pamphlet denounced the tariff as unjust and unconstitutional. It declared that states should declare it null and void within their borders, or **nullify** the law.
###Effect
At first, South Carolina was unable to pass the nullification vote, which required 2/3 approval. However with Congress' new Tariff of 1832, which had taken some of the "abominations", the Southerners were unsatisfied. The state legislature called for a special convention, and the delegates called for the tariff to be null and void within South Carolina. 

###Jackson's Response
Angered at South Carolina's definance, Jackson dispatched naval and military reinforcements and prepared a sizable army. 

###Henry Clay's Compromise tariff of 1833

####Overview
Although he supported tariffs, Clay didn't want Jackson to become more popular by defeating South Carolina. Thus, he backed the bill that would gradually reduce the Tariff of 1832 by 10% over the period of 8 years. 

Congress at the same time also passed the **Force Bill**, which gave the president the ability to use the army and navy to collect federal tariff duties.

####Popularity
The South favored it while New England and the middle states did not.
####Outcome
The South Carolinians, recieving no more support from other states, took this bill as an opportunity to stop the nullification process. The Carolinians had another convention, where they repealed their previous nullification, and nullified the Force Bill as a last act of defiance.

##Jackson and the Native Americans

###Overview
In 1828, despite the Cherokee tribe "civilizing themselves" in the way of whites, the Georgian legislature declared the Cheokee council illegal and asserted its own jurisdiction of all Indian lands and affairs. The Cherokee appealed this in the Supreme Court, which upheld their rights three times. However, Jackson refused to accept their decision, and in 1830 got the **Indian Removal Act** passed. The act essentially forced all Indian tribes easy of the Mississippi to move into present day Oklahoma. Over the following decade, countless Native Americans were forced to march on what was known as the Trail of Teras, where thousands died. The **Bureau of Indian Affaris** was established in 1836, but they quickly went back on their promises as well, and moved the Indians again.

##Election of 1832

###Overview
Featuring the entrance of a third party, the <a href="#The-Anti-Masiconic-Party">Anti-Masonic</a> party, the election was won by a large margin by Andrew Jackson.

###Precendents

1. The calling of national nominating conventions
2. Adopting formal platforms, publicizing their positions on the issues

##The Anti-Masiconic Party

###Overview
Appealed to American suspicions of secret societies (which Americans believed to be reserved to the privledged). However Jackson himself was a Mason (and publicized it) and thus the party was also an Anti-Jacksonian Party.

##Martin Van Buren

###Overview
Chosen by Andrew Jackson as the nominee (due to the Petticoat Affair), he ran a successful campaign for president against the to-be-unified Whig party

##Election of 1836

###Overview
The newly formed whig party ran 3 candidates against the Democrats, who only ran one (Martin Van Buren). This failed on them, and Buren easily won.

##Electon of 1840

###Overview
The Democratic party renominated Martin Van Buren, and the Whig party, now unified, united William Henry Harrison, hero from the Battle of Tippecanoe. He ran as "the common man" against "the corrupt aristocrat" of "Martin Van Ruin". Harrison won.

###Effect
The election marked a turn in what was considered popular in American democracy. Aristocracy was now considered unrespectable, and many politicians publicly apologized for being unable to claim a humble birthplace.

The election also showed the change to a two party system. 

###Democrats
1. State's Rights
2. Federal Restraint in social and economic affairs

###Whigs
1. A renewed national bank
2. Protective tariffs
3. Public schools
4. (Starting to believe in this) moral reforms like prohibition and abolition



##Black Hawk War 1832

###Overview
Angry about broken government promises and the Trail of Tears, the Sauk and Fox braves from Illinois and Wisconsin were led by **Black Hawk** in a war. They were defeated by Lietenant Jefferson Davis of Mississippi (Future President of the Confederacy) and by volunteers, notably Captain Abraham Lincoln (Future President of America).


##Panics

!!! note "Panic = Recession"

###Panic of 1819 

#### Cause
- Overspeculation in frontier lands

#### Effect
- The Bank of the US forced speculative ("wildcat") banks to foreclose on countless farms
	- This greatly angered the western debtor (this would lead them to back Jackson)
		- In addition, the inhuman imprisonment of debtors angered Westerners more, and families in the West went on hard times, sowing seeds of Jacksonian democracy

###Panic of 1837 


####Cause
- Overspeculation in the West
- Failed Jacksonian Finance
- Farming Failures (The Hessian fly destroyed the wheat crop)
- 2 British banks fell, which resulted in British investors calling in foreign loans

####Effect
- The collapse of hundreds of banks
	- Some pet banks also fell, with them several million in government funds
- Factories closed

####The Whig Party's Solution
- Expansion of Bank Credit
- Higher Tariffs
- Internal Improvements through Subsidies

####Martin Van Buren's Solution
- **Divorce Bill**
	- Believed that problem came from injecting federal funds in private banks
	- Thought that the government should be "divorced" from banking completely
	- The bill would establish an independent treasury, where funds would be save, but no credit would be given 
	- The bill lasted one year, but was reenacted in 1846 until the Civil War when Republicans created a network of national banks

##The Texas Revolution People And Events
###Overview
Overtime, wanting more land, Americans migrated to Texas.  However, they actively defied Mexican laws when they were there, such as the prohibition on slavery. When Stephen Austin went to discuss differences at Mexico City, he was jailed for eight months. This led to a full on rebellion, with Sam Housin as the commander-in-chief.

After some fighting, the Texans were able to capture Santa Anna and got him to agree on Texan independence. However, once he escaped, he said the agreement was illegal because he signed the document under duress. 

Due to the face that Texas was not techinically free from Mexico, the US had its hands tied. Therefore, they did not accept Texas as a state, but instead recognized its independence. Texas would eventually become part of the union in 1845 by John Tyler.
