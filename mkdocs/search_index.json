            "text": "Jamestown 1607\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nJamestown was the first British colony in America, founded in 1607 by the Virginia Company of England\n\n\nCause\n\n\nThe joint-stock Virginia Company founded the colony looking for gold. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nIts charter guaranteed the overseas settlers the same rights that they would get if they stayed in England. This part of the charter was eventually extended to all of the colonies.\n\n\nThe Establishment of the Colonies\n\n\nThe South\n\n\n\n\nFirst Colony: Jamestown, Virginia\n\n\nMaryland: Catholic Haven formed by Lord Baltimore\n\n\nCarolina founded in 1670\n\n\nGeorge created as buffer colony\n\n\nSouthern Colonies\n\n\nAll dependent on agriculture\n\n\nPracticed Slavery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe North\n\n\n\n\nFirst Colony: Plymouth Bay Colony, in Massachusetts\n\n\nGreat English Migration causes 70,000 to come to Americas, 20,000 form MA\n\n\nRhode Island formed by Roger Williams\n\n\nNew Netherlands -\n New York\n\n\nPennsylvania formed by Penn\n\n\n\n\nCalvinism-Puritanism\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n1517: Martin Luther nails his 95 Theses -\n John Calvin of Geneva founds Calvinism, which becomes the religion of the Puritans. \n\n\nKing Henry VIII breaks from Catholic Church, wants to keep same customs, but Puritans in England believe they should \"Purify\" the Anglican Church into Calvinism. A group of Puritans, the Seperatists, break away entirely from the Church -\n Form Plymouth\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nPuritans founded the New England and Massachusetts Bay Colonies and dominate Connecticut.\n\n\nEthnic, religious, social diversity in the colonies\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\nSwedes in Deleware\n\n\nGermans were 6% of the population, and came fleeing war\n\n\nmostly Lutheran Protestants\n\n\nmostly in Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScots-Irish, 7% of population\n\n\ncame for tolerant Pennsylvania\n\n\nfound that the best land was already taken by the Germans and Quakers\n\n\npushed out and attacked Indians for land, became first frontiers\n\n\nvery rebellious group of people, and were anti-Native American\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity by Colony\n\n\n\n\nPuritans were the least ethically diverse.\n\n\nMiddle Colonies were diverse (many different white immigrants)\n\n\nSouth displayed its historic black-and-white composition\n\n\n\n\nJohn Winthrop\n\n\nThe Massachusetts Bay Colony's first Governor.  \n\n\nOverview\n\n\nVery religious, propelled Massechusetts as a beacon to humanity and a model, religious society. Made the colony one of the biggest and most influential of the New England Outposts. Made Massachusetts into a fur trading, fishing and primarily, shipbuilding industry powerhouse.\n\n\nRoger Williams (Founded Rhode Island in 1635)\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nPopular Salem minister who challenged the Bay Colony's charter and Puritan values.\n\n\n\n\nDenied authority of civil government to regulate relgious behavior (the fundemental construct of Puritan society)\n\n\nChallenged the colony's stealing of land from Indians\n\n\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nKicked out of Massachusetts in 1635, Williams fled to the Rhode Island area in 1636, and built a Baptist church. Established complete freedom of religion, even for Jews and Catholics. Demanded no oaths regarding religous beliefs, no taxes for a state church, and even sheltered the Quakers.\n\n\nAlso gave universal suffrage (though property requirements eventually were added).\n\n\nMade Rhode Island as the most liberal and advanced of all settlements in the New World and Old World alike.\n\n\nWilliam Penn (Founded Pennsylvania in 1681)\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nQuaker Englishman who founded the colony of Pennsylvannia in 1681. Bought land from Indians (as opposed to stealing, like most other colonies) and organized his cities. Had an unusually liberal regime included a representative assembly elected by landowners. There was no tax-supported church, and freedom of religion was granted to all settlers, though England forced Penn to deny Catholics and Jews the right to vote or hold office. There was no military, no restrictions on immigration, and naturalization was an easy process. The Quakers disliked slavery and Pennsylvania promoted a modern atmosphere giving economic opportunity, civil liberty, and religious freedom. \n\n\nJohn Smith\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCaptain John Smith was an early savior of the Virgina colony. He turned the inital colonists from gold hungry colonists to look for food and start farming.\n\n\nJohn Rolfe\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nFather of the tobacco industry and the economic savior of Virginia. Also husband to Pocahontas.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nBy 1612, Rolfe had perfected methods of raising tobacco, and started selling it to Europe. Soon, the demand became so strong that almost all colonists switched to growing tobacco and began looking for more land. This led to more expansion against Native American land. Also led to higher demand for labor, which was first supplied by Indentured Servants, and eventually (after Bacon's Rebellion), African slaves.\n\n\nBacon's Rebellion 1676\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nBacon's Rebellion was a rebellion in 1676 led by Nathaniel Bacon.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nThe rebellion consisted of freedmen (ex-indentured servants) who were angry that they didn't get the land that they migrated for. In addition, due to a lack of single women in the colonies, they were unable to find wives.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nFearful for another rebellion, the landed gentry of the South (Planter Class) began looking for an alternative source of labor. They settled on Africa, thus sparking the slave trade and the South's dependence on slave labor\n\n\nPeter Stuyvesant\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nPeter Stuyvesant was a Dutch Directors-General who attacked the Swedish in New Sweden (Delaware).\n\n\nCause\n\n\nAngered that the Swedish trespassed on the Dutch preserves, the Dutch sent Peter to take out the Swedish forces in New Sweden (Delaware).\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe colonists of old New Sweden were absorbed into the New Netherlands, and the colony eventually became Delaware)\n\n\nNew England Confederation 1643\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nFounded in 1643 by the colonists of the Massachusets Bay Colonies and the Connecticut Colonies.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nThe Confederation was formed during the English Civil War, in order to defend themselves against the Indians, French, and Dutch. Each colony only had two votes, which angered the populous Massachusets Colony. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nWhile it was extremely weak and Puritan exclusive, the Confederation was the first considerable milestone to colonial unity. From 1640-1660, when England went through its Civil War, the colonies operated on autonomy, which resulted in a independent culture in the Americas.  The Confederation was disbanded in the 1660s, when King Charles II took power. (Replaced with Dominion of New England)\n\n\nDominion of New England 1686\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe Dominion of New England included New England, New York, and East and West Jersey\n\n\nCause\n\n\nIn 1686, royal authority created the Dominion of New England to promote efficiency in the administration of the English Navigation Laws. This was part of an effort by the monarchy to tie the colonies closer to the motherland by restricting trade with only England. The Dominion was lead by Sir Edmund Andros, who heavily taxed the people and enforced the hated Navigation Laws, nearly caused a revolt within the colonies. The Dominion was disbanded after the Glorious Revolution in England of 1689.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAs a result of these laws, colonists turned to smuggling and colonists began to share similar sentiments against England.\n\n\nThe Half-Way Covenant and the Salem Witch Trials 1660s\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe Salem Witch Trials were trials held across New England settlements prosecuting 'witches', who were actually mostly women from commerical families.\n\n\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, preachers began preaching jermiads, worried by declining religios devotion. In 1662, ministers announced the \nHalf Way Covenant\n, which was a new form of Church membership that allowed the baptism of non-converted members.     \n\n\nAs a result of expanding Puritan membership, the link between the elect and the others broke, which further diluted the spiritual purity from the original Puritans. This eventually led to the Puritan Church opening its doors to everyone, led to and end of strict religious purity. Also led to an increase of women in the Puritan congregation, who came to make up the majority of churchgoers. This eventually lead into the Salem Witch trials, where most of the accused women came from Salem's growing market economy and the accusers came from the farming families in Salem. They reflected the widening social gaps of New England and the fear that Puritan Heritage was dying out to Yankee commericalism.\n\n\nThe Great Awakening (1730s-1740s)\n\n\nCause\n\n\nIn the early 18th century, religion was sagging in the colonies. The Puritans in particular, were fighting against liberal ideas that suggested that not just the 'elect' get to go to heaven. \nArminianism\n, the theology preached by Jacobus Arminius, preached that an individual's free will determined a person's eternal fate, and that all humans, not just the elect, could go to heaven if they accepted God's grace. A few Puritan churches accepted this, leading into more emotional packed sermons, also known as the \nGreat Awakening\n.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe Awakening's emphasis on direct, emotional spirituality damaged the authority of the older clergy, who had relied on their education for their authority. This lead to many more different churches and schisms in the religion. It also lead to the creation of American colleges like Princeton and Brown and others to promote higher learning and clergy training. Most importantly, the Awakening was the first mass movement of the American people, that united many of the American people.\n\n\nImportant Preachers\n\n\nJonathan Edwards\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIgnited the Great Awakening. Believed in salvation through good works and was fairly popular, but was overshadowed by Whitefield 4 years later.\n\n\nGeorge Whitefield\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nGeorge Whitefiled was a famous preacher during the Great Awakening, and represented the ideas of great emotional preaching during the time.\n\n\nHeadright System\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nLaw that gave the right to acquire 50 acres of land if you pay the passage of an indentured servant.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nVirginia and Maryland passed this system in order to make it more favorable to bring in indentured servants to work the land, which would increase each colony's economy.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe system greatly benefitted the masters who brought slaves to the New World, and they eventually became the great merchant-planters of the South, also known as the Planter Class. (Washington and many other of the founding fathers belonged to this class).\n\n\nIndentured Servants\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIndentured Servants were people who boarded ships to America, who voluntarily sold themselves to virtual slavery for a fixed amount of time in exchange for passage to the New World, and (maybe) land after they became free.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nDue to a \"surplus\" of men in England and a growing Tobacco industry in America, a demand for labor was sparked.\n\n\nWhy not African Slaves?\n\n\nSince African slaves were more expensive and morality rates were high in the South (Primarily the Chesapeake), Africans were seen as a bad investment, and so the landowners turned to indentured servants instead.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nLed to an even more increased reliance on agriculture in the South. Eventually, after Bacon's Rebellion, the planters would turn to African slaves.\n\n\nTriangular Trade\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe trade between New England, Africa, and the West Indies.\n\n\nNew England gave rum, Africa took the rum for slaves, the West Indies gave molasses for the slaves, and the molasses went to New England for more rum.\n\n\nMiddle Passage\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe passage where slaves were transported across, in cruel conditions. Africans were mostly sold to Newport, Rhode Island, or Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n\nThe French and Indian War 1754-1763\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nStarted by George Washington in 1754 when he accidentally shot the French Diplomat\n\n\nEffects\n\n\nLed to Britain nearly bankrupting itself, which meant they needed to now tax the colonists. See \nSalutary Neglect\n for more information.\n\n\nAlbany Congress 1754\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCongress summoned by the British government to (short-term) keep the Iroquois loyal to the British and (long-term) unite the colonies together to create a common defense against the French.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAnother attempt for colonial unity, 7/13 colonies showed up.\n\n\nWilliam Pitt 1757\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAlso known as \"The Great Commoner\", William Pitt was a leader who in 1757 took power in the London government. Pitt's efforts ultimately resulted in victory in the French and Indian war.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nSee the terms of the Battle of Quebec (Below)\n\n\nBattle of Quebec 1759\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nMarked the end of the French and Indian War. \n\n\nThe Terms\n\n\nThe end of the war resulted in Spain and England taking all of French territory, and England taking Spain, resulting in England as the dominant power in North America and as the leading naval power in the World.\n\n\nMercantilism\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe belief that a country's military and political power was measured by its wealth which was measured by the amount of gold or silver a country had. To acquire gold or silver a country needed to \nexport more than it imported\n. Thus, owning colonies were strategic as they could supply raw materials and a guaranteed market to export to.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAs a result, the London government treated the Americans as tenants, and initially enforced laws like the Navigation Acts of 1650 to keep colonials only trading with Britain. However, the colonies eventually became so prosperous that the British stoppped bothering to enforce these laws as they were profitting so heavily off of colonial trade. However after the French and Indian War, the British treasury went nearly bankrupt, forcing the British to enforce the laws again. This angered the colonials as they had been used to self-government under British \nsalutary neglect\n.\n\n\nSalutary Neglect 1714-1763\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nA period of time from 1714-1763 when England didn't enforce many of its laws (Navigation Laws and Taxes). Arguably in effect since 1607.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe Americans became increasing self-reliant and resistant to taxes, causing problems after the French and Indian War (1763) when the British needed the colonists to help pay off debt from the war.\n\n\nProclamation of 1763\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nProhibited settlement in the area beyond the Appalachian moutains.\nIssued by the British government in oreder to work out the Indian problem and prevent another revolt like Pontiac's Uprising.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAngered Americans who thought they had won that land after winning the French and Indian War and after crushing Pontiac's Uprising, several expanded into prohibitted areas anyways.\n Marked more splitting with British policy by the colonists.\n\n\nActs of 1764 - 1765\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nSugar Act (1764)\n\n\nIncreased duty tax on sugar imported form the West Indies.\nOffenders of this act and the stamp act were forced to appear in \nadmirality courts\n where juries were not allowed, and defendants were \"guilty until proven innocent\"\n\n\nQuartering Act (1765)\n\n\nLaw that forced the colonials (mostly in New England) to house British troops.\n\n\nStamp Act (1765)\n\n\nTax on stamps, mostly effected the wealthy, Samuel Adams incited colonials \"No Taxation without representation\"\nLed to Stamp Act Congress of 1765\n\n\nStamp Act Congress\n\n\n9 colonies sent representatives, decided on \nnonimportation agreements\n against British goods. (Common boycott from the colonies against British goods)\n\n\nDeclatory Act 1766\n\n\nCause\n\n\nAfter withdrawing the Stamp Act, Parliament passed the Declatory Act which reaffirmed Parliaments right to bind the colonies in all cases. Effectively stated that the British government would not tield its control over its colonies.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nSet the stage of a continuing confrontation between the colonists and the British.\n\n\nTownshend Acts 1767\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nPassed in 1767 by efforts from Charles Townshend.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe Acts added a duty on glass, white lead, paper, paint, and tea. Made the taxes an indirect customs duty. However, the colonists were mostly just angry at being taxed without representation. \n\n\nAlso, since the tax income was meant to be used to pay the salaries of the royal governors (The Americans had long since been controlling Royal Governors through their salaries) the colonists saw this as another attempt to control them. \n\n\nLed to more smuggling and nonimportation agreements (Similar to those passed by the Stamp Act Congress) which lead to the British sending more troops to the colonies to keep law and order. (eventually led to Boston Massacre).\n\n\nSamuel Adams\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nSamuel Adams was a political organizer who led many protests against English taxation and ran \nThe Sons of Liberty\n, a British opposition group. Helped to unite against Britain. Without Adams, it is likely that the Revolution we know today would never have existed.\n\n\nCommittees of Correspondence\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOrganized by Samuel Adams, the first in 1772 Boston. They kept the British opposition alive and gave Adams a network to spread propoganda.\n\n\nJohn Hancock\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nSamuel Adams' financial backer. A \ntrader\n smuggler, Hancock was angered by British when they began enforcing the Navigation Acts (anti-smuggling) the Stamp Acts (caused him to pay more on imports) and others. He found Adams interesting as he was a great organizer, and Hancock decided to back him and his rebel group \nThe Sons of Liberty\n.\n\n\nBoston Massacre 1770\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIn 1770, a clash between 60 townspeople and a squad of 10 redcoats led to 11 casualities. Samuel Adams called on Paul Revere to make an engraving of the incident and Adams circulated these all across the colonies, sparking anger against the British governments.\n\n\nBoston Tea Party 1773\n\n\nCause\n\n\nIn 1773, the British East India Company, facing bankruptcy, was given a monopoly of the American tea buisness. The corporation sold tea to the colonies at a cheaper rate than before, even with taxes. This angered John Hancock in particular, who was unable to sell his tea anymore. He and Saumel Adams rallied colonists against this, seeing it as a disguised tax. Thus, on December 16, 1773, colonists attacked tea ships in Boston Harbor and poured out all the tea into the harbor.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nResulted in the \nIntolerable Acts\n\n\nIntolerable Acts of 1774\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAfter the Boston Tea Party, Parliament responded with these Acts in an attempt to deal with the situation.\n\n\nActs: \n\n\n\n\nBoston Port Act: Closed the harbor until damages were paid back\n\n\nRestrictions were also placed on local town meetings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuartering Act: Gave local authorities power to lodge British soldiers anywhere, even in private homes\n\n\nQuebec Act: \nMore Information\n\n\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nConsidered as the massacre of American Liberty. Also led to \nThe First Continental Congress\n in 1774. \n\n\nQuebec Act 1774\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nPassed with the \nIntolerable Acts of 1774\n, the Quebec Act was actually a good law. The law gave the French Canadians the right to Catholicism and the right to keep their old customs and instituions (which didn't allow trial by jury). Additionally, the law gave the province of Quebec the Ohio River as its new Southern boundary.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAmerican colonists were angered that the Canadians got land that they had planned to move into, and angered Anti-Catholics.\n\n\nFirst Continental Congress 1774\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n12/13 colonies met to address colonial grievances. Acted as a consultative body to decide what to do about the Intolerable Acts.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nJohn and Samuel Adams moved a proposal for American home rule under British direction. The Congress also drew up several papers, including the Declaration of Rights and appeals to other colonies, the king, and the British people.\n\n\nThe biggest action was the creation of \nThe Association\n\n\nThe Association 1774\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCalled for a complete boycott of British goods. A combination of nonimportation, nonexportation, and nonconsumption. However, this was not a call for independence, instead, the colonists simply wanted to call of the offensive taxation and return to the state of America before the French and Indian War.\n\n\nLexington/Concord 1775\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIn response to the Association, the British commander in Boston sent troops in April 1775 to Lexington and Concord to steal colonial gunpoweder and capture Samuel Adams and John Hancock.\n\n\nAt Lexington, a group of \nMinute Men\n tried and failed to stop the British, resulted in 8 dead Americans. However, the British were forced to retreat at Concord, where a large force of Americans dealt 300 casualties to the British.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nEffectively started the revolutionary war. \n\n\nBunker Hill 1775\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe first battle of the Revolutionary War, colonists seized Bunker Hill (Breed's Hill at the time) and mowed down advancing redcoats.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe French began to look at the colonists as an actual force, King George abandoned all hope of reconcilliation (Despite the July 1775 \nOlive Branch Petition\n), and hired thousands of German troops (Hessians) in addition to British troops to fight the war in America. The hiring of German troops shocked the colonists, who felt that the war was a \"family matter\".\n\n\nThe Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776)\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAlso known as \"Jefferson's explanation of Independence\", this document was formal declaration of \nRichard Henry Lee\n's resolution.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAppealed universally and gave a long list of reasons on why the colonies were leaving, primarily to inform the French that they had nothing to fear in helping the colonies win independence.\n\n\nThomas Paine (Common Sense 1776)\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nBritish writer who wrote \nCommon Sense\n, an extremely influential pamphlet.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\n\nStates only derive their powers from the consent of the governed.\n\n\nUnless America is independent, they cannot hope for foreign assistance\n\n\nCalled for creation of a \nrepublic\n, where power flowed from the people\n\n\nPromoted \ncitizen virtue\n, the concept that a citizen must sacrifice their personal needs for the collective good of a nation\n\n\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAs a result of the pamplet, he effectively gave Washington an army by convincing enough people that there was a reason to fight.\n\n\nBattle of Saratoga 1777\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOn October 17, 1777, British General John Burgoyne surrendered to American General Horatio Gates\n\n\nCause\n\n\nExplain this later, its pretty complicated\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAt this point, the French were just waiting for one big victory by the colonists before they sent troops; this battle did that, and allowed Americans to get foreign aid. The victory itself was also an immense morale booster, and revived the faltering colonial cause.\n\n\nYorktown 1781\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nDecisive victory that effectively ended the Revolutionary War. \n\n\nCause\n\n\nCornwallis had retreated into the Chesapeake Bay at Yorktown at one of the few times during the war when the French controlled the seas. Admiral de Grasse covered the seas, General Washington and French General Rochambeau assaulted Cornwallis on land, forcing him to surrender on October 19, 1781.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nSee the \nTreaty of Paris\n\n\nTreaty of Paris 1783\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nSigned in 1783, the Treaty of Paris officially ended the Revolutionary War.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nAfter the battle of Yorktown, the British were finally forced to draw an end to the war.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe terms of the treaty were as followed:\n\n\n\n\nThe US gets all land from Mississippi (Western boundary) to the Great Lakes (Northern boundary) to Spanish Florida (Southern boundary).\n\n\nAmerica holds a share in the fisheries of Newfoundland (angered Canada)\n\n\nCongress must recommend state legislatures to return confiscated Loyalist property\n\n\nThe states must not put any legal obstacles in paying off debt",

This conflicted directly with the \nNew Jersey Plan\n, which called for equal represntation in Congress. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe Great Compromise resulted in a bi-cameral legislature, in which there would be a Senate in which all states have equal representation and a House of Representatives where states would send delegates based on population.\n\n\nThis compromise plan was known as the Connecticut plan.\n\n\nFederalists\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nBelieved in a strong federal government, supported the constitution. Eventually died out after the election of Thomas Jefferson. Their chief rival, the Anti-Federalists, evolved into the Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican party.\n\n\nImportant Federalists\n\n\n\n\nAlexander Hamilton -  Leader of the Party\n\n\nGeorge Washington - Though not officially a federalist, he backed most Federalist ideas as president\n\n\nJohn Marshall - 4th Chief Justice of the US, kept Federalist ideas alive and well through the Supreme Court even when the Federalist Party was dead\n\n\nJames Madison - Wrote the Constituion, but became a Democratic-Republican later\n\n\nJohn Adams -  2nd President of the USA, had a very unpopular presidency but his Federalist actions may have saved the country (Looking at you, early war with France)\n\n\nJohn Jay - 1st Chief Justice\n\n\n\n\nThe Federalist Papers\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCollection of essays that discuss the need for the Constituion. They also explain how the Constituion will work, and are used to this day to interpret the Constitution\n\n\nAuthors\n\n\n\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n\n\nJohn Jay\n\n\nJames Madison\n\n\n\n\nWhiskey Rebellon 1794\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nRebellion by poor famers against the federal government\n\n\nCause\n\n\nAs part of his financial plan, implemented an excise tax on whiskey, which hurt many in south-western Pennsylvania. The people there felt the tax was being imposed on a economic necesity (as whiskey was used as a form of payment). The protesters tarred and feathered revenue officers just as the original Revolutionaries had done.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nWashington, not tolerating these \"self-created societies\", with Hamilton's encouragement, called up the militias of many states and crushed the rebellion. By using such a force, Washington gained a new respect for his government - but also some criticism at such massive use of force.\n\n\nHamilton and the Bank of the US\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nHamilton proposed a bank for the us that would be a powerful private institution of which the government would be the major stock holder and in which the Federal Treasury would deposit excess money. Thus, the central government would have a strongbox and also stimulate buisness by being in circulation. In addition, the bank would be able to print needed paper money.\n\n\nJefferson opposed completely, and said that only the states could charter banks (literal interpretation of the Constitution). Hamilton however, argued that Congress can pass out any laws to carry out the powers vested in various government agencies (Article I, Section VIII, Paragraph 18). Essentially, Hamilton argued that government had the power to collect taxes and regulate trade, and thus they could create this Bank. \n\n\nJay's Treaty\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThis was a treaty that John Jay signed in order to keep peace with Great Britain.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nWashington's Farewell\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nWashington's resignation speech which set several impotant precendents regarding power and international affairs.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nTwo Terms\n: Washington only served for two terms, and thus every president except FDR (Fighting WWII needed a consistent voice) also did so.\n\n\nNo Intertangling Alliances\n: Washington argued that we should not make any permanent alliances without nations (looking at you, alliance with France). Washington did however approve \ntemporary\n alliances. This set US Foreign policy until WWII (That war changed a lot)\n\n\nAlien and Sediton Acts 1798\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nLaws passed under the John Adams administration that made it a crime to impede government policies or falsey defame its officials (Sedition) and gave the president the power to import or imprison immigrants during times of hostitility (Alien).\n\n\nCause\n\n\nThe Alien Act was passed to give more power with a war against France becoming more and more iminent. In addition, a significant portion of Jeffersonian Democrats were immigrants, and were opposing Adams.\n\n\nDuring his administration, Adams was often ridiculed, often by members of his own party (*ahem* \nAlexander Hamilton\n). In addition, at that time, the verbal violence was unrestrained, and many writers (some of them exiled aliens) sought out to destroy Adams. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThey increased Jeffersonian resentment to the laws and the Federalist system, especially because the Supreme Court refused to ruled against the laws (as the Court was very federalist).\n\n\nThis eventually resulted in the \nVirginia and Kentucky Resolutions\n.\n\n\nVirginia and Kentucky Resolutions 1798-1799\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nJefferson and Madison, angered by the Alien and Sedition Acts, wrote these resolutions that said that states were the final authority of whether the federal government overstepped its powers granted by the constitution. He said that therefore, if a state believed that the federal government had overpassed its power, it would have the power to \nnullify\n the law they find offensive. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nStates Rights arguers will go back to this. Also, the concept of nullification will come back in the South Carolinian nullification crisis\n\n\nXYZ Affair\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIncident in France in which Adams sent his diplomats (including John Marshall) to negotiate with French foreign minister Talleyrand about hostilities the US was facing after they had accepted Jay's Treaty. (The French were attacking US Ships and refused to accept the US Ambassador).\n\n\nHowever, once Adams' diplomats reached France, French agents X, Y, and Z (identities kept secret) demanded 32 million florins + $250,000 as a bribe to just talk to Talleyrand.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nNegotiations broke down, and the diplomats were treated like heroes for not caving in. The slogan \"Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute\" became popular.\n\n\nAlso, Jeffersonian Democrats, who had backed the French, took to the shadows as their Pro-French views suddenly became popular. \n\n\nWar Preperations\n\n\nAfter the affair, the government decided to start preparing for war. The Navy Department was created, Marine Corps were reestablished and the nation was about to fall into war, if it wasn't for Adams' wise choice to negotiate more with Talleyrand. At France, the \nConvention of 1800\n was signed, and the nations remained at peace. If Adams had not signed the treaty and instead went to war, he would have most likely won a second term. However, his willingness to peace likely helped Jefferson when he went to buy Louisiana just three years later.\n\n\nWashingtons First Cabnet\n\n\n\n\nJohn Adams\n: Vice President (Not actually part of the cabinet, but he's here)\n\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n: Secretary of the Treasury\n\n\nThomas Jefferson\n: Secretary of State\n\n\n\n\nNo one else matters :P, but here they are anyways:\n\n\n\n\nHenry Knox\n: Secretary of War (We call this 'Defense' today)\n\n\nEdmund Randolph\n: Attorney General\n\n\n\n\nBill of Rights\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIn order to pass the Constitution, the Federalists promised that a Bill of Rights would be added later. \n\n\nJames Madison, original author of the Constitution, decided to write the 10 amendments that would become the first 10 amendments of the Constitution and would be called \"The Bill of Rights\"\n\n\nJudiciary Act of 1789\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOrganized the Supreme Court (John Jay became Chief Justice), and also established the federal district and circuit courts and the office of attorney general.\n\n\nPinckney's Treaty of 1795\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nTreaty with Spain that gave the United States free navigation of the Mississippi, warehouse rights at New Orleans, and Western Florida.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nJay's Treaty.\n\n\nMarbury vs Madson\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nA court case that decided that the Supreme Court of the United States had the final say on whether an act was constitutional.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nIn his last days of the presidency, John Adams passed the Judidicary Act of 1801, which essentially filled the entire Justice branch of the government with Federalists. Jefferson, angry at this, threw the law out. However, William Marbury sued for his commission, and his case went to the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall, dismissed his case, but explained his ruling saying that the part of the Judiciary Act Marbury was basing his case on was unconstituional. This gave the Supreme Court the power of \njudicial review\n.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nPower went to federal government, not the states.\n\n\nThe Jeffersonian \"Revoluton of 1800\"\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe election of Thomas Jefferson in 1800. \n\n\nSignificance\n\n\nThe first peaceful transition of power in history\n\n\nLousiana Purchase\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAfter Spain ceded Louisiana to France, Americans in the area lost the warehouse rights they gained from Pinckney's treaty, which hurt the frontier farmers who relied on this to make a living. Sensing potential problems (what if Napoleon tried to create an American Empire after Europe?), Jefferson sent Monroe to join Livingston in France to try to buy New Orleans. However, due to the \nHatian Revolution\n, Napoleon had lost interest in a North American empire, and due to British pressure on him, Napoleon decided to keep America away from Britain's arms and sell Jefferson not just Louisiana, but the \nentire territory of Louisiana\n. Monroe and Livingston accepted, needless to say.\n\n\nProblems\n\n\nWhile Jefferson liked the purchase, he could not help but feel that he had overstepped his authority as President, as he had only been given authority from Congress to buy the city of New Orleans (though Congress was happy to pay for all of Louisiana).\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nJefferson envisioned this new area as the \"Valley of Democracy\", that would allow for a great agrarian republic. The purchase also showed Washington's idea of avoiding entangling alliances, as Jefferson made the purchase without swearing loyalty to any countries in the process.\n\n\nEmbargo Act 1807\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nDue to war between Britain and France, both countries began stopping all trade going into the other country. America, which was trying to stay neutral, was losing many merchant ships to both countries, especially Great Britain, which was practicing \nimpressment\n on American sailors and seizing American ships (France did too, not as much). Jefferson, believing that both countries relied heavily on American trade, decided that an embargo would convince both countries into working out a deal to trade with America.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\n\n\nThe Embargo failed, and instead nearly destroyed the Northern economy (which completely relied on trade)\n\n\nThis in turn led to the Hartford Convention\n\n\nAlso led to massive ts after the war\n\n\nThat led to the Nullification Crisis (South Carolina)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacon's Bill #2 \n\n\n\n\nMacon's Bill #2\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nReopened trade with all countries, but if either France or Britain reopened commercial restrictions, the embargo would renact against that nation. (basically admitted that the US could not survive without either France or Britain)\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nNapoleon vaguely told America that French restrictions may be removed if Britain removed theirs, which Madison gambled and accepted the note as French repeal and asked for Britain to remove their laws. However, Britain didn't , and the US had no choice but to put an embargo against Britain, thus ending American neutrality. (War)\n\n\nWar Hawks\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nYoung men who sought war with Britain. They were frustrated that Britain was hurting/impressing American sailors.\n\n\nThey also wanted to wipe out the Indians as they were a threat to the pioneer settlers who were migrating west.\n\n\nChesapeake Affair 1807\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIncident where a British captain demanded the surrender of four \nalleged\n deserters after stopping a US frigate, \nThe Chesapeake\n. The American captain refused, and the the British warship fired attacks at the ship, killing three Americans and wounding 18 others, and the British took the four deserters away.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe people of the US' anger against Britain spiked, and a roar of national wrath occured, and people started calling for war.\n\n\nJudiciary Act 1801\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCreated 16 new judgeships and other federal offices. Seen as a last-ditch grab of power of Adams. Jefferson threw the law out, which lead to William Marbury lawsuit. Which led to \nMarbury vs Madison\n\n\nLewis and Clark\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nTwo explorers employed by Thomas Jefferson to explore the newly purchased Louisiana Territory.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThey went further than the Louisiana territory, and found the west coast. They also documented their travels extensively, discovered many new plant and animal species, and created a map of the new area.\n\n\nNon-Intercourse Act\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nFormally reopened trade with all foreign nations \nexcept\n France and Britain (the two most important).\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAs a result of this and the 1807 Embargo Act, the New England Yankees were left with no option but to reopen newfactories and open new ones, thus creating the foundations of modern America's industrial might.\n\n\nNorthwest Ordinance of 1787\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCreated the Northwest territory.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nIt established the precedent by which the Federal government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states.\n\n\nJohn Marshall\n\n\nBiography\n\n\nJohn Marshall was a strong federalist and the fourth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He kept the ideals behind Federalism alive and well even when the Federalist Party died out. With \nMarbury vs Madison\n, he set the precendent of Judicial Review. In the below court cases, you will learn about the other precendents he set.\n\n\nMcCulloch v Maryland\n\n\nIn this suit, the state of Maryland tried to destroy a branch of the Bank of the US by imposing a tax on its notes. Marshall declared the bank constituional and that Maryland did not have the right to tax the bank. He argued \nthat the power to tax involves the power to destroy\n and \nthat a power to create implies a power to preserve\n. \n\n\nThis set the doctrine of \nloose construction\n, the idea that powers not explicitly stated in the Constitution belong to the Federal government.\n\n\nMarshall also said that the Bank cannot pay taxes because \nStates do not supercede the Federal Government\n, thus saying that \nthe federal government had more power than state governments\n\n\nDartmouth v Woodward\n\n\nThe state of New Hampshire had decided to revoke Darthmouth College's charter (given by King George III in 1769). Marshall said that the original charter must stand, and that the Constituion protected contracts from state encroachments. This protected buisness enterprise from state domination, but it also enabled charter corporations to escape public control.\n\n\nCohens v Virgnia\n\n\nTwo brothers were arrested for illegally selling lottery tickets, and while Virginia still won, Marshall used the case to asert that \nThe Supreme Court had the right to review decisions of State Supreme Courts\n. \n\n\nGibbons v Ogden\n\n\nThe State of New York had tried to grant a monopoly of waterborne commerce beween NY and NJ, but Marshall reminded NY that control of interstate commerce remained with Congress alone.\n\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nWritten by \nJohn Quincy Adams\n and \nJames Monroe\n, it said argued two features: Noncolonization and Nonintervention\n\n\nNoncolonization\n\n\n\n\nSaid that the era of colonization in America was over\n\n\nNo more countries could come to the Americas to colonize\n\n\nPartly directed to the Russians in the Northwest coming down from Alaska\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonintervention\n\n\n\n\nTold the monarchs of Europe to keep their monarchy out of their hemisphere/ the Americas\n\n\nSaid that the US would not intervene in the Greek war of independence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Webster\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n261\nA strong federalist and friend of John Marshall. He was famous for challenging states rights and nullification. He was also a strong supporter of the Bank of the US.\n\n\nThe \"North America Review\"\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nA highly intellectual magazie that began publication in 1815, showed how American produced materials were increasing after the War of 1812.\n\n\nAmerican System\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nHenry Clay's idea of politics.\nCalled for:\n\n\n\n\nA strong protective tarifff\n\n\nThis would allow for eastern manufacturing to florish \n\n\nFunds from this would pay for another component\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Network of Roads and Canals\n\n\nPaid by the tarifff\n\n\nWould allow the transportation of food and raw materials from the South and the West and the North and the East\n\n\nFocused in the Ohio Valley, this would knitt the country econmically and politically\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Strong Banking System\n\n\nThis would provide easy and abundant credit \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThis entire system was eventually implemented, though all seperately and not all as one bill.\n\n\nEra of Good Feelngs\n\n\nWhy So Happy?\n\n\nRising nationalism after the War of 1812 (the Americans believed they had defeated the British yet again) led to a 'happy era of good feelings'. Also, with only one party left, this left Monroe and the Republicans to one-party rule.\n\n\nExceptions\n\n\nThe issue of tariffs, the bank of the US, internal immprovements, and the sale of public lands was hotly debated over of. Also, sectionalism was increasing and the debate of slavery was reentering the public forum.\n\n\nTecumseh and Tenskwatawa\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThey were two Shawnee brothers, also known as Tecumseh and the Prophet, who believed that the time had come to fight the Americans. They created a confederacy of all tribes east of the Mississippi and attacked. In the \nBattle of Tippecanoe\n, the Prophet foolishly attacked Harrison's army, and lost their settlement, resultin in the Prophet being discredited. Tecumseh allied with the British and fought in the War of 1812, but died at the Battle of the Thames in 1813. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe fall of Tecumseh meant the end of an Indian Confederacy.\n\n\nTreaty of Ghent 1814\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nEssentially an armistice between Britain and the US. \n\n\nCause\n\n\nBritain was preoccupied with the Congress of Vienna, and didn't want to deal with the US. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe Americans believed that they had 'won' the war, which led to massive nationalism, see the \nEra of Good Feelings\n for more information\n\n\nHartford Conventon 1814 - 1815\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nFrustrated by embargoes by the US government, the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island sent full representation to a convention at Hartford. New Hampshire and Vermont sent partial representation. The men met in complete secrecy and wrote a list of all their grievances and a few delegants called for seccession. The grievances demanded financial assistance to compensate for lost trade and a Constitutional amendment requiring a 2/3 vote to pass an embargo. Delegates also wished to remove the 3/5 clause of the Constitution, limit Presidents to a single term, and prohibit the election of two successive presidents from the same states (All but one president (Adams) had been from Virginia). However before the grievances were delivered, the Treaty of Ghent was signed, and so the grievances were never considered.\n\n\nSignificance\n\n\nReflected a Federalist fear that New England was alling to the agrarian South and West. Also marks first attempt at seccession.\n\n\nHenry Clay\n\n\nWhat he did\n\n\nJames Madson\n\n\nWhat he did\n\n\nWillam Henry Harrison\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nBecame a war hero after fighting Indian forces at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. He used his popularity to become president in 1841, but he died after a month, leaving his disliked vice president, John Tyler, to become president.\n\n\nBattle of New Orleans\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe biggest victory for the US in the War of 1812. The battle featured Andrew Jackson as a war hero, who was praised for dealing the most devastating defeat of the entire war. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAll though the battle didn't matter (occured after the Treaty of Ghent was signed), the battle made Andrew Jackson a national hero and unleashed a wave of nationalism and confidence.\n\n\nOliver Hazard Perry\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAmerican naval officer who built a small fleet of ships on Lake Erie and captured a British fleet, thus keeping American control of the lake. His slogan, \"We have met the enemy and they are ours\" breath a new life into the American cause in the war.\n\n\nWar of 1812\n\n\nImpact\n\n\nShowed that the US would go to war to resist grievous wrongs. Other nations gained a new respect for America'a fighting prowess, and naval officers like Perry and Macdonough were respected more. American emmisaries abroad were treated with more respect. However the war's embargo seriously hurt the New England economy and increased sectionalism between the New England Federalists, and the entire party was destroyed.\n\n\nMissouri Compromse 1820\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nNegotiated by Henry Clay, this compromise kept the balance of power between the North and the South and remained in use until 1854.\n\n\nTerms\n\n\n\n\nAdmitted Missouri as a slave state\n\n\nCreated the state of Maine from Massachusets to keep the balance in the Senate\n\n\nProhibited all slavery in the future above the 36\u00b0 30' line (the southern boundary of Misouri)\n\n\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nPreserved the shaky compact of the states, but only ducked the question of the South's \npelicular institution\n (term for slavery).\n\n\nThe \"Corrupt Bargain\"\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nControversial election in which Andrew Jackson won more votes (popular and electoral) but didn't have a majority to win. Henry Clay, the speaker of the house, disliking Jackson, got the House to support John Quincy Adams. Because he was named the new secretary of state shortly after, many believed that a corrupt bargain was taken.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nLed to Adams losing trust and failing in his second run for president.\n\n\nJohn Quincy Adams\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nA brilliant Secretary of State under Monroe, ineffective President, and influential Congressman.\n\n\nImpact\n\n\n\n\nWrote Monroe Doctrine\n\n\nShaped US Foreign Policy\n\n\nNegotiated Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819 (Florida Purchase Treaty)\n\n\nOutspoken in his opposition to slavery\n\n\n\n\nElection of 1828/Jacksonian Revolution\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe overwhelming election of Andrew Jackson in 1828.\n\n\nImportance\n\n\nCalled the \"Jacksonian Revolution\" because of the high voter turnout from people who recently gained the right to vote (poorer people) which was reflected in the 95 electoral vote landslide Jackson won by.\n\n\nThe Spoils System\n\n\nUpon taking office, Jackson replaced most officals with new ones from his new party. This led to some inefficiency, as some qualified officials were booted for incapable, yet loyal, counterparts.\n\n\nNicolas Biddle\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe president of the Bank of the United States. He held an immense (many people believed unconstitutional) amount of power over the financial affairs of the US.\n\n\nHe was immensely hated, as his bank's very existence to some seemed to sin against the idea of American democracy. His bank also had much opposition in the West due to foreclosures on many western farms. The bank prioritized profit over public service.    \n\n\nSecond Bank of the US\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nPart of Henry Clay's American System. It was submitted for renewal under the Jackson Administration by Henry Clay (in order to make it an election issue) but it was rejected by Jackson, who declared the bill \"unconstitutional\". By doing so, he vastly amplified the power of the presidency by regarding the executive branch as the most powerful branch of the government.\n\n\nAndrew Jackson Removes the Bank\n\n\nIn 1833, Jackson decides not just to wait for the Bank to die in 1836, but to instead destroy it. He believed that he had been given a mandate from his voters for its complete exterminiation. \n\n\nHe started by removing federal deposits from the bank, it order to bleed the bank dry. His cabinet, advising him not too, was reshuffled around until Jackson found a Secretary of the Treasury who was willing to do what Jackson asked. \nHowever once the Bank completely died, it left a financial vaccum in the US Ecnonmy and launched a lurching cycle of booms and busts. SUrplus funds were placed in several state banks called \npet banks\n. These pet banks and smaller 'wildcat' banks - which were very informal, often just chairs and money in a room - flooded the economy with new paper money. Jackson tried to reign in the economy with the \nSpecie Circular\n, which required that all public lands be purchased with \"hard\" money (metallic). This destroyed the speculative boom, leading to the Panic of 1837.\n\n\nTariffs\n\n\ntariff of 1816\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe first tariff in American history instituted more protection first, then revenue.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nAfter the War of 1812, British competitors dumped goods on the US, cutting their prices in half in an effort to destroy American factories as they were being born. The tariffs, passed as part of Clay's American System, were passed to protect the new industry.\n\n\nTariff of 1828 / Tariff of Abominatons\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nPassed in 1828, this tariff was passed again to help Northern industry. However this one was promoted by Ardent Jacksonites, expecting the bill to be defeated, which would hurt Adams during his presidency. However, it passed, leaving Jackson to deal with it.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nSoutherners were particularly outraged by this tariff, and labeled it, the \"Tariff of Abominations\". However, the South was frustrated that the rest of America was doing well economically and they were falling on hard times, leaving the tariff as a scapegoat. Additionally, the South was worried that Congress would soon pass a bill prohibiting slavery, and the South wanted to test the theory of \nnullification\n, that is, the idea that States have the right to nullify a federal law. This took effect in the \nNullification Crisis\n\n\nNullification Crisis\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe South Carolina legislature published a pamplet, called \nThe South Carolina Exposition\n. Secrety written by \nJohn C. Calhoun\n, the Vice President of the United States, the pamphlet denounced the tariff as unjust and unconstitutional. It declared that states should declare it null and void within their borders, or \nnullify\n the law.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAt first, South Carolina was unable to pass the nullification vote, which required 2/3 approval. However with Congress' new Tariff of 1832, which had taken some of the \"abominations\", the Southerners were unsatisfied. The state legislature called for a special convention, and the delegates called for the tariff to be null and void within South Carolina. \n\n\nJackson's Response\n\n\nAngered at South Carolina's definance, Jackson dispatched naval and military reinforcements and prepared a sizable army. \n\n\nHenry Clay's Compromise tariff of 1833\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAlthough he supported tariffs, Clay didn't want Jackson to become more popular by defeating South Carolina. Thus, he backed the bill that would gradually reduce the Tariff of 1832 by 10% over the period of 8 years. \n\n\nCongress at the same time also passed the \nForce Bill\n, which gave the president the ability to use the army and navy to collect federal tariff duties.\n\n\nPopularity\n\n\nThe South favored it while New England and the middle states did not.\n\n\nOutcome\n\n\nThe South Carolinians, recieving no more support from other states, took this bill as an opportunity to stop the nullification process. The Carolinians had another convention, where they repealed their previous nullification, and nullified the Force Bill as a last act of defiance.\n\n\nJackson and the Native Americans\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIn 1828, despite the Cherokee tribe \"civilizing themselves\" in the way of whites, the Georgian legislature declared the Cheokee council illegal and asserted its own jurisdiction of all Indian lands and affairs. The Cherokee appealed this in the Supreme Court, which upheld their rights three times. However, Jackson refused to accept their decision, and in 1830 got the \nIndian Removal Act\n passed. The act essentially forced all Indian tribes easy of the Mississippi to move into present day Oklahoma. Over the following decade, countless Native Americans were forced to march on what was known as the Trail of Teras, where thousands died. The \nBureau of Indian Affaris\n was established in 1836, but they quickly went back on their promises as well, and moved the Indians again.\n\n\nElection of 1832\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nFeaturing the entrance of a third party, the \nAnti-Masonic\n party, the election was won by a large margin by Andrew Jackson.\n\n\nPrecendents\n\n\n\n\nThe calling of national nominating conventions\n\n\nAdopting formal platforms, publicizing their positions on the issues\n\n\n\n\nThe Anti-Masiconic Party\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAppealed to American suspicions of secret societies (which Americans believed to be reserved to the privledged). However Jackson himself was a Mason (and publicized it) and thus the party was also an Anti-Jacksonian Party.\n\n\nMartin Van Buren\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nChosen by Andrew Jackson as the nominee (due to the Petticoat Affair), he ran a successful campaign for president against the to-be-unified Whig party\n\n\nElection of 1836\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe newly formed whig party ran 3 candidates against the Democrats, who only ran one (Martin Van Buren). This failed on them, and Buren easily won.\n\n\nElecton of 1840\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe Democratic party renominated Martin Van Buren, and the Whig party, now unified, united William Henry Harrison, hero from the Battle of Tippecanoe. He ran as \"the common man\" against \"the corrupt aristocrat\" of \"Martin Van Ruin\". Harrison won.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe election marked a turn in what was considered popular in American democracy. Aristocracy was now considered unrespectable, and many politicians publicly apologized for being unable to claim a humble birthplace.\n\n\nThe election also showed the change to a two party system. \n\n\nDemocrats\n\n\n\n\nState's Rights\n\n\nFederal Restraint in social and economic affairs\n\n\n\n\nWhigs\n\n\n\n\nA renewed national bank\n\n\nProtective tariffs\n\n\nPublic schools\n\n\n(Starting to believe in this) moral reforms like prohibition and abolition\n\n\n\n\nBlack Hawk War 1832\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAngry about broken government promises and the Trail of Tears, the Sauk and Fox braves from Illinois and Wisconsin were led by \nBlack Hawk\n in a war. They were defeated by Lietenant Jefferson Davis of Mississippi (Future President of the Confederacy) and by volunteers, notably Captain Abraham Lincoln (Future President of America).\n\n\nPanics\n\n\n\n\nPanic = Recession\n\n\n\n\nPanic of 1819\n\n\nCause\n\n\n\n\nOverspeculation in frontier lands\n\n\n\n\nEffect\n\n\n\n\nThe Bank of the US forced speculative (\"wildcat\") banks to foreclose on countless farms\n\n\nThis greatly angered the western debtor (this would lead them to back Jackson)\n\n\nIn addition, the inhuman imprisonment of debtors angered Westerners more, and families in the West went on hard times, sowing seeds of Jacksonian democracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPanic of 1837\n\n\nCause\n\n\n\n\nOverspeculation in the West\n\n\nFailed Jacksonian Finance\n\n\nFarming Failures (The Hessian fly destroyed the wheat crop)\n\n\n2 British banks fell, which resulted in British investors calling in foreign loans\n\n\n\n\nEffect\n\n\n\n\nThe collapse of hundreds of banks\n\n\nSome pet banks also fell, with them several million in government funds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactories closed\n\n\n\n\nThe Whig Party's Solution\n\n\n\n\nExpansion of Bank Credit\n\n\nHigher Tariffs\n\n\nInternal Improvements through Subsidies\n\n\n\n\nMartin Van Buren's Solution\n\n\n\n\nDivorce Bill\n\n\nBelieved that problem came from injecting federal funds in private banks\n\n\nThought that the government should be \"divorced\" from banking completely\n\n\nThe bill would establish an independent treasury, where funds would be save, but no credit would be given \n\n\nThe bill lasted one year, but was reenacted in 1846 until the Civil War when Republicans created a network of national banks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Texas Revolution People And Events\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOvertime, wanting more land, Americans migrated to Texas.  However, they actively defied Mexican laws when they were there, such as the prohibition on slavery. When Stephen Austin went to discuss differences at Mexico City, he was jailed for eight months. This led to a full on rebellion, with Sam Housin as the commander-in-chief.\n\n\nAfter some fighting, the Texans were able to capture Santa Anna and got him to agree on Texan independence. However, once he escaped, he said the agreement was illegal because he signed the document under duress. \n\n\nDue to the face that Texas was not techinically free from Mexico, the US had its hands tied. Therefore, they did not accept Texas as a state, but instead recognized its independence. Texas would eventually become part of the union in 1845 by John Tyler.",

When Stephen Austin went to discuss differences at Mexico City, he was jailed for eight months. This led to a full on rebellion, with Sam Housin as the commander-in-chief.  After some fighting, the Texans were able to capture Santa Anna and got him to agree on Texan independence. However, once he escaped, he said the agreement was illegal because he signed the document under duress.   Due to the face that Texas was not techinically free from Mexico, the US had its hands tied. Therefore, they did not accept Texas as a state, but instead recognized its independence. Texas would eventually become part of the union in 1845 by John Tyler.",

During the debates, the two candidates debated slavery, popular sovereignty, and the Dred Scott decision.\n\n\nFreeport Doctrine\n\n\nAt the second debate in Freeport, Illinois, Douglas answered the \nFreeport Question\n. (\"If the people of a territory vote down slavery, do the people's decision take priority of the Supreme Court ruling on Dred Scott?\"), and said that slavery would stay down if the people voted so (ie the supremacy of popular sovereignty). This answer proved to destroy his popularity in the South and led to the splitting of the Democratic Party in 1860.\n\n\nEffects\n\n\nLincoln\n\n\nDuring the debates, Lincoln's open opposition on slavery was publicized, as the debates had gained national coverage. Through the debates, many Eastern newspapers published the debates, and Lincoln began to emerge as a possible Republican candidate for president.\n\n\nDouglas\n\n\nDouglas' Freeport Doctrine hurt his standing with Southern Democrats greatly, in addition to his opposition to the Lecompton Constituion of Kansas.

The cotton state delegates left the convention. The Democrats tried again in Baltimore, Maryland, but most Southern delegates walked out, leaving Stephen Douglas to be nominated.\n\n\nNorthern Democratic Platform\n\n\n\n\nPro Popular Sovereignty\n\n\nAgainst obstruction of the Fugitive Slave Act (for Southern appeal)\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Democratic Nomination\n\n\nAfter Douglas' nomination, the Southern delegates held a rival convention in Baltimore and nominated John C.
